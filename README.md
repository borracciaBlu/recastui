<h1 align="center">Build Simple, Accessible &amp; White-label Websites & Apps fast! ⚡</h1>

<br>

Recast UI provides a set of accessible, themeable, reusable, and composable React + Tailwind
components that make it super easy to create performant white-label websites and apps.

## ⚠️ WARNING ⚠️

RecastUI is in under heavy development, focus will be on the next major version (`v1.0`).

This project is not ready **YET** for production, use at your own risk.

## Why use Recast UI ?

- **Ready to go**: Start your project with over 40+ well designed React(currently, Solid, Svelte to come in future) Tailwind components.
- **Automatic Dark Mode**: No need to write `dark:...` classes in your code. No conditional logic required. Recast uses [Radix-color](https://www.radix-ui.com/colors) pallets to automatically create dark variants equivalent for the used color pallet. All components are built with dark mode in mind.
- **Composable**: Compose your UI with reusable building blocks.
- **Accessible**: Recast UI follows WAI-ARIA standards, helping you to reach the largest audience possible with less effort.
- **Themeable**: Use Recast UI's design system or customize it using the theming features focusing on building white-label websites and app products. All components are built with theming in mind using [CVA](https://github.com/joe-bell/cva).
- **Typescript**: All components are typed and focus on improving DX.
