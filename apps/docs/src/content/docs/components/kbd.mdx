# Keyboard Key

The keyboard key component exists to show which key or combination of keys performs a given action.

## Import
<CodeBlock code={ kbdSnippets.import } client:visible/>

## Usage
<Playground code={ kbdSnippets.usage } client:visible/>

## Guideline
All shortcuts should do their best to match what appears on the user’s keyboard.

All single letters A-Z are uppercase.
For non-letter keys such as enter, esc and shift, stick to lowercase.
Use the arrow symbol as opposed to spelling things out.

## Modifier
The only punctuation you should need is the + to indicate that a combination of keys will activate the shortcut.
<Playground code={ kbdSnippets.usage } client:visible/>
For a sequence of keys where one must follow the other, write "then" in between. Stick to lowercase to match the non-letter keys.

<Playground code={ kbdSnippets.then } client:visible/>

If two different keys can execute the same action or the shortcut itself may look different on the user’s keyboard, write "or" in between.
<Playground code={ kbdSnippets.or } client:visible/>

## Size
There are three sizes available: *'sm*', *'md*', *'lg*'. Default is *'sm*'.
<Playground code={ kbdSnippets.size } client:visible/>

## Props
| Prop | Type | Description |
| ---- | --- | --- |
| children | React.ReactNode | The content of the Kbd component |
| className | string (optional) | Additional class names to apply |
