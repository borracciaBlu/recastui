# Drawer

The Drawer component is a panel that slides out from the edge of the screen. It can be useful when you need users to complete a task or view some details without leaving the current page.

## Import
<CodeBlock code={ drawerSnippets.import } client:visible/>

## Usage
<Playground code={ drawerSnippets.usage } client:visible/>

### Drawer placement positions
The Drawer can appear from any edge of the screen. Pass the `position` prop and set it to `top`, `right`, `bottom`, or `left`. Defalut is `left`.
<Playground code={ drawerSnippets.position } client:visible/>

### Drawer sizes
Pass the size prop if you need to adjust the size of the Drawer. Values can be `xs`, `sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl`, or `full`. Default is `xs`.
<Playground code={ drawerSnippets.sizes } client:visible/>

### Focus on specific element
When a form is in the drawer, you might need to set focus on a specific element when the drawer opens. Pass the `initialFocusRef` prop.

Without the initialFocusRef prop, the drawer will set focus on the first focusable element when it opens.
<Playground code={ drawerSnippets.initialFocus } client:visible/>

## Accessibility

This Drawer component has been designed to follow best practices for accessibility:

- Focus is trapped within the drawer when it is open.
- Focus is automatically set to the first enabled element or the element specified by `initialFocus`.
- When the drawer closes, focus returns to the element that was focused before the drawer was activated, or the element specified by `finalFocusRef`.
- Clicking on the overlay closes the drawer.
- Pressing the `Esc` key closes the drawer.
- Scrolling is blocked on the elements behind the drawer.
- The drawer is rendered in a portal attached to the end of `document.body`, making it easy to add `aria-hidden` to its siblings.
- `aria-modal` is set to `true` on the `DrawerContent` component.
- `aria-labelledby` is set to the `id` of the `DrawerHeading` component.
- `aria-describedby` is set to the `id` of the `DrawerBody` component.
