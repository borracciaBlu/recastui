# Modal

A Modal component is a dialog that focuses the user's attention exclusively on an information via a window that is overlaid on primary content.

## Import
<CodeBlock code={ modalSnippets.import } client:visible/>

## Usage
<Playground code={ modalSnippets.usage } client:visible/>

### Manage Focus after Modal Closure
Upon closing the dialog, focus reverts to the element that initiated it. Adjust the element that gains focus after the modal closes by setting *'finalFocusRef'*.
<Playground code={ modalSnippets.finalFocus } client:visible/>

### Close Modal on Overlay Click
By default, the modal closes when you click its overlay. You can set *'closeOnOverlayClick'* to *'false'* if you want the modal to stay visible.
<Playground code={ modalSnippets.closeOnOverlayClick } client:visible/>

### Make modal vertically centered
By default the modal has a vertical offset of 4rem(64px) which you can change by passing top to the ModalContent. If you need to don't vertically center the modal, pass the *'isCentered'* prop. Default is set to *false*.
<Playground code={ modalSnippets.centered } client:visible/>

## Modal Sizes
Pass the size prop if you need to adjust the size of the modal. Values can be `xs`, `sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl`, or `full`. Default is `md`.
<Playground code={ modalSnippets.size } client:visible/>

## Accessibility

This Modal component has been designed to follow best practices for accessibility:

- Focus is trapped within the modal when it is open.
- Focus is automatically set to the first enabled element or the element specified by `initialFocusRef`.
- When the modal closes, focus returns to the element that was focused before the modal was activated, or the element specified by `finalFocusRef`.
- Clicking on the overlay closes the modal (configurable with `closeOnOverlayClick` prop).
- Pressing the `Esc` key closes the modal.
- Scrolling is blocked on the elements behind the modal (configurable with `blockScrollOnMount` prop).
- The modal is rendered in a portal attached to the end of `document.body`, making it easy to add `aria-hidden` to its siblings.
- `aria-modal` is set to `true` on the `ModalContent` component.
- `aria-labelledby` is set to the `id` of the `ModalHeader` component.
- `aria-describedby` is set to the `id` of the `ModalBody` component.
